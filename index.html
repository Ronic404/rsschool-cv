                    worthy, versatile people. I want to work with foreign companies and 
                    create something new for people from all over the world. 
                    It is important that the organization has a friendly atmosphere, 
                    career opportunities, and exciting projects. Having worked in various 
                    companies that are not related to IT, I realized that the profession 
                    of a programmer is what I would like to do all my life. Independently 
                    I study <span class="underline">HTML, CSS, JS</span> for about six months, I know for sure that 
                    I will not give up, I will do 100%, I am ready to go to my dream 
                    no matter what.</p>
                </li>
                <li>I know <span class="underline">HTML, CSS and a bit of JS.</span> I can make up on PSD.</li>
                <li class="js">
                    <pre>
  javascript 
    function sumInput() {
    let numbers = [];
    while (true) {
      let value = prompt("Введите число", 0);
      if (value === "" || value === null || !isFinite(value)) break;
      numbers.push(+value);
    }
    let sum = 0;
    for (let number of numbers) {
      sum += number;
    }
    return sum;
    }
    alert( sumInput() );
