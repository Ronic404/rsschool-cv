3. I really want to become a cool programmer, work with interesting, worthy, versatile people. I want to work with foreign companies and create something new for people from all over the world. It is important that the organization has a friendly atmosphere, career opportunities, and exciting projects. Having worked in various companies that are not related to IT, I realized that the profession of a programmer is what I would like to do all my life. Independently I study HTML, CSS, JS for about six months, I know for sure that I will not give up, I will do 100%, I am ready to go to my dream no matter what.
4. I know HTML, CSS and a bit of JS. I can make up on PSD.
5. ``` javascript 
    function sumInput() {
    let numbers = [];
    while (true) {
      let value = prompt("Введите число", 0);
      if (value === "" || value === null || !isFinite(value)) break;
      numbers.push(+value);
    }
    let sum = 0;
    for (let number of numbers) {
      sum += number;
    }
    return sum;
    }
    alert( sumInput() );```
